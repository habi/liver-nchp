# Materials & Methods
# micro-CT imaging

After $PREPARATION, the 7 samples were imaged on a Bruker SkyScan 1272 high-resolution microtomography machine (Control software version 1.1.19, Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium).
The machine is equipped with a Hamamatsu L11871_20 X-ray source and a XIMEA xiRAY16 camera which converts the x-rays into visible light and records the projection images.
The X-ray source was set to a tube voltage of 100.0 kV and a tube current of 100.0 µA, the x-ray spectrum was filtered by 0.11 mm of copper prior to incidence onto the sample.
For each sample, we recorded a set of 2 or 3 stacked scans to overlap the total sample height.
Each stack was recorded with 1895 projections of 4904 x 3280 pixels at every 0.1° over a 180° sample rotation.
On average, every single projection was exposed for 4796 ms, 3 projections were again averaged to greatly reduce image noise.

The projection images were then subsequently reconstructed into a 3D stack of images with NRecon (Version 1.7.4.2, Bruker microCT, Kontich Belgium) without any beamhardening correction and a medium ring-removal correction.
The whole process resulted in tomographic datasets with an isometric voxel size of 5 µm.
